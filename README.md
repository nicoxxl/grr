# grr

## What is grr ?

Grr is a mix between a scripting language and a data description format, like if you do not know if you should use JSON or a scripting language.

The project is split in multiples parts, the first is the parser, which is independant of the rest (you can use it to make your own language).

## Why ?

Because I wanted to.

## Why the name ?

Because it makes you angry. Or when you are angry because you can not find this middle ground.
